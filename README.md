Fundamentals of Data Analysis, a brief look at global temperature over the past 250 years. <br/>
This high-level look at global temperature data over the past 250 years is meant to provide a brief behind-the-scenes look at the preparatory work involved in the data analysis process. 

The project uses SQL and Python, and is also meant to showcase the format and structure of Jupyter (or iPython) Notebooks; interactive documents which allow for the execution of python scripts within the cells of the document itself. (NOTE: The online snapshot of the notebook hosted on GitHub is non-interactive) 

### Main
**README.md - This table of contents.**<br/>
**[Complete.py](Complete.py) - full python script with comments**<br/>
**[Weather_Report](Weather_Report.ipynb) - _(this is what you want to look at)_ Notebook-style report final report.**<br/>

### Data_subscripts
**[QUERY.sql](data_subscripts/QUERY.sql) - sql query used to retrieve data from database**<br/>
**[format.py](data_subscripts/format.py) - reads data into python and reshapes it to be more useful**<br/>
**[analyze.py](data_subscripts/analyze.py) - applies a function for computing moving averages over a user-defined interval**<br/>
**[display.py](data_subscripts/display.py) - displays output plots (one made with pyplot, one made with pandas)**
